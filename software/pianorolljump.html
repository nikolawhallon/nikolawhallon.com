<h2>Piano Roll Jump</h2>

Piano Roll Jump is an iOS game I developed in 2016, though I had the 
idea for the game several years earlier.
<br>
<br>
Piano Roll Jump is a simple but intense platforming experience.
<br>
<br>
The notes from the background music move right to left like they would 
in a piano roll, and you must jump to touch as many notes as you can to 
increase your score. Falling will lower your score.
<br>
<br>
Tap the screen to jump and double jump. Use the accelerometer to move 
left and right, and increase or decrease gravity for a high level of 
precision control. Master the controls and become a platforming 
champion.
<br>
<br>
The background music was all written using retro video game hardware for 
a nostalgic 8-bit aesthetic.
